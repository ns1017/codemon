# codemon
Codemon is a Pok√©mon inspired python3 project I've made after working through Codedex's Python course. I'm having fun with it so it's going here. All credit to Nintendo for inspiration.

How to play v1.2:

*If you have a save file or .pkl, it needs to be in the same directory/folder as the codemon.exe.
**If you have a save file a from a previous version, it most likely won't work.

Begin by chooising your starter codemon, all menus are navigated by numerical inputs or yes/no inputs. 

Battles:

- Have a random trainer and codemon opponent each time
- Scaled leveling to the user's codemon
- Allow user to level up their codemon
- Have a flee & do nothing option
- Unique heavy attacks with individual animations
- Codemon type effectiveness muiltipliers

TO ADD: 
- npc trainer overhall + balancing (Sometime theyre OP)
- spd stat for battle randomness
- more attacks
- weakness system

Hunt:

- Real (system) time base codemon appearances
- Legendary (1%) "codegon" codemon appearance chance. (can also be used as a starter)
- Chance to miss codemon during hunt, also possible second chance catch in hunt

TO ADD:
- add rare modifier for enhanced codemons
- make hunts more interative allowing user to choose places to hunt also incorperating ascii art

General Mechanics:

- Heal function heals all codemon to max hp, can only be used at the main menu
- View codemon function allows you to see your codemon and their stats.
- Save and exit generates or updates your save file and... exits!

TO ADD: 
- Codedex
- Storyline
- More art
- gym/badges + trainer revamp.
